# big_text_reader
Show big text file quickly.

I need a text file viewer to show big text file content in seconds.

First version is a SublimeText 3 plugin.
line 1: file path
line 2: start point
page size: 10000 char

How to use it:
1. Input file path in 1st line.
2. Input start point in 2nd line.
3. Input search keyword in 3rd line.
3. Hot key cmd+alt+T to run plugin.

Keyword will be searched in text, and renew start point to 1st found point.
One page of text from start point of the file will show in SublimeText editer view.
